What is Win32 API?
• The Win32 API (Application Programming
Interface) is a core set of Microsoft Windows operating system interfaces that programmers use to build software applications.
• This API interacts directly with the underlying Windows OS to handle tasks like creating and managing windows, handling user input (like keyboard and mouse events), drawing graphics, and managing files and processes.

The Win32 API is divided into several libraries:
• User32.dll: Manages the standard graphical user interface elements, such as windows, dialogs, and menus.• Gdi32.dll: Handles tasks related to graphics drawing, text output, font management, and other graphical operations.
• Kernel32.dll: Provides core functionalities like memory management, process and thread creation, and file handling.
• Advapi32.dll: Manages advanced services such as registry access, security settings, and service controls.

• Historically, the Win32 API was crucial fordeveloping native applications on Windows.• Newer programming frameworks like .NET andlanguages such as C# have become popular forWindows development, the Win32 API is still usedextensively, especially for applications thatrequire close interaction with the operatingsystem or for legacy software maintenance.
